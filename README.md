# CS465
Classwork repo for CS465 Full Stack Dev 1
Located on branch cs465.


In terms of the architecture of this project, we utilized a few ways to develop the front end. Overall they all have some dynamic features. SPA will tend to incorporate short functions instead of lots of HTML. Javascript is all dynamic so that's a plus. Can't really go wrong. JSON data integrates through the backend and sends your backend data to the front end so you can manipulate it. For testing, there is a lot going on there. You can split testing up into front end and back end but they do have calls that rely on each other. If you tag certain fields with data values from your backend, a field named deviceType with a backend field actually called campusMapping will give you errors. It's important to follow the conventions of the backend data you want so you avoid compilation problems. Overall this course helped me put some context behind my internship. If I am being honest, I have learned far more through my actual internship using a few dedicated tools.
